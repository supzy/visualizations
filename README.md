visualizations
==============

Sample visualization code for exported Supzy data.

Check the directory corresponding to the type of Supzy data you've exported for sample visualizations.

NOTE: Desktop exports contain slightly different columns than web exports for both group and personal data, so be sure to get the samples matching the type of export you created!

About the Code
--------------
All sample code is simple HTML5/Javascript using the excellent [D3.js](http://d3js.org "D3.js") library. You don't need a server to run these - just open the HTML file in a browser and select the file you want to process.

These examples are very basic, but will hopefully give you ideas for interesting things to do with your data.  Have fun!
